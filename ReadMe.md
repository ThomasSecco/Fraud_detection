# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project 💳 🔍

## 🌟 Overview
This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data 🛡️💸. It showcases skills in:
- ✨ Feature Engineering
- ⚖️ Handling Imbalanced Data
- 📊 Model Training & Evaluation

If you're interested in building a powerful fraud detection system or exploring how machine learning can catch fraudsters, this project is for you! 🚨

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), containing thousands of transactions labeled as fraud or non-fraud. A perfect playground for testing your machine learning skills! 🧠


Install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Project Structure
Here's a quick look at the project files:
- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset (download from Kaggle and place here).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for each project stage.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`models/`**: Folder to save trained models for future use.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Install Requirements**: Make sure all libraries are installed.
2. **Explore the Notebooks**: Run each notebook in this order:
   - 📊 `01_EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
   - 🛠️ `02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
   - 🤖 `03_Model_Training.ipynb`: Model Training & Evaluation
3. **Using Scripts**: To retrain directly from the command line, run:
   - `scripts/data_preprocessing.py`
   - `scripts/model_training.py`
   - `scripts/model_evaluation.py`

## 👀 See it in Action!
This project demonstrates how to tackle **imbalanced data** using **SMOTE** and other techniques. It also explores model interpretability, helping to make fraud detection transparent and effective! 🕵️‍♀️

Happy coding and fraud-busting! 💻💥
